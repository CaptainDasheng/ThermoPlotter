"""Provides pre-sized axes.

The style is based somewhat on the Nature guidelines (we can all
dream!), where the axes.one figure has a width of 8.6 cm. All axes are 
square, and subsequent figures maintain the height of axes.one per plot
(single height plots have a height of 8.3 cm whilst double height plots
have a height of 16.6 cm, which more effectively maintains relative
scale, as legends etc. are normally added on the side). As per the
guidelines, font size is 8 pt.
